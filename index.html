            <section class = "About Me">
                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I grew up in a small town of Mexico called AguaPrieta which borders with Douglas AZ. After going to highschool in Douglas I applied to the University of Arizona. Although at first I was unsure which of which engineering discipline to choose, I took the decision of declaring as a software engineering major. 
                    I can gladly say that I as I am going through my second year in this major I have thoroughly enjoyed the classes geared towards my career and am excited to keep learning new skills and about the innovations that are possible throug software. I like to practice challenge myself by doing projects such as this one!
