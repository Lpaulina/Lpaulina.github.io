                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>I grew up in a small town of Mexico called AguaPrieta which borders with Douglas AZ. After attending Douglas High School I decided to continue my education at the University of Arizona. Although at first I was unsure of which engineering discipline to settle on, after my first semester I declared as a software engineering major. 
                    I can gladly say that as I continue to learn through my second year about software engineering I have thoroughly enjoyed the classes geared towards my career and am looking forward to keep learning new skills and learning about the innovations that are possible through software. I like to challenge myself by doing projects such as this one!
