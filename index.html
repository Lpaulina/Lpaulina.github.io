                <h1>About Me</h1>
                <p>
                   I grew up in a small town of Mexico called AguaPrieta which borders with Douglas AZ. After
                   attending Douglas High School I decided to continue my education at the University of Arizona. 
                   Although at first I was unsure of which engineering discipline to settle on, after my first 
                   semester I declared as a software engineering major. I can gladly say that as I continue to learn 
                   through my second year about software engineering I have thoroughly enjoyed the classes geared towards 
                   my career and am looking forward to keep learning new skills and learning about the innovations that 
                   are possible through software. I like to challenge myself by doing projects such as this one!

                        I started playing basketball when I was 8 years old. While at first I was not
                        very passionate about it, the more I stuck with it the more I started to like it.
                        this sport taught me many lessons and continue to play once in a while when I get 
                        the chance to do so. I got to play for my state's team in Mexico!</p>
